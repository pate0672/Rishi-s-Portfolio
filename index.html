              <p class="font-weight-bold">"It's not GOALS that differentiates between winners and losers."</p>
              <p>I read this in a book and I believe in this sentence very strongly, because a winner and loser can have
                similar big goals, but it's the immense lack of execution every single day differentiates them. I feel rather
                than focusing on just big goals, focus on giving your 200% every single day and you will win big. For example, if you
                are playing a basketball match, you cannot spend the whole match just looking at the scoreboard as that would only create
                baseless pressure on yourself, rather you can focus on giving your best every single ball and life is just like that. 
                I am here to learn every single day and make a change in the world.

                  <p>My primary focus is on building Front End Web Applications, Native Mobile Applications, Integrations, Alexa Skills, and Google Actions.
                    My skillsets include languages like JavaScript, React Native, CSS3, HTML5, C# together with frameworks like React JS, Node JS, and Bootstrap.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    I do this because I love the process of turning dreams into reality by converting ideas into code. I have a serious passion for designing the top-grade UIâ€™s with working logic to create a dynamic user experience.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    I have spent the past two years learning top-notch technologies and enhancing my skill sets. I have developed a Voice Assistant for Canada Border Services Agency(CBSA), made a real-time chat application, and helped small businesses to grow on the internet.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    I graduated from Algonquin College in Mobile Application Design and Development with a 3.9/4 GPA.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    On a side note, I love teaching programming, playing volleyball, and learning new technologies every day. It is something that allows me to be creative, connect with people, and even just bring people together through teaching.</p>

              <p>I have developed CBSA Helper with a team to help Canadain travellers know about prohibited items and personal exemptions in a more efficient way. We have developed Amazon Alexa Skill 
                and Google Action. We used a Node JS code outside of Alexa's and Dialogflow's console which helped us to have only one code for both platoforms. We also implemented Firestore Firebase
                 to store user's conversation and send it to them over email and text message with Sendgird and Twilio.
<br/> <br/>
            â€¢ With a team, developed Google Action and Amazon Alexa skill to teach about border rules and regulations

            â€¢ Involved in project managing, developing the Google Action, and the API
            <br/>
            â€¢ Improved the userâ€™s search speed by 80% from 5 to 1 min
            <br/>
            â€¢ Implemented the UX process to increase productivity by 20%

                Unfortunately, we have seen the biggest pandemic in human era and that did messes up a lot of people's lives. It is a hard time for everyone as we have to check the number of cases every signle day and hoping for it to end and I used to check
                stats of COVID-19 on worldometer.com and I was very curious how did it worked, so I started building my own and utilized the unfortunate time with a team. We started from very scratch by creating it's design in a piece of paper and then drew it in figma software called draw.io. 
                We were so convinced to do it very properly so we also created a business and technical requirement document with user stories just to learn and practise. Later, we started building it and displayed the Map using the Google Maps API and fetched the covid data from an 
                API("https://disease.sh/v2/historical/all?lastdays=150"). We used chart.js library to display beautiful looking charts and I also wrote an article on how to prevent COVID-19 and had an CTA at the bottom of the page to access it.
                <br/>
                I would say it was not possible without my team and the credit also goes to:<br/>

                You guys were a great team to work with.

              <h4 class="subheading text-muted">Built with JavaScript(ES6), Bootstrap 4, HTML5, and CSS3.</h4>
              <p>This is an Online Text Editor very similar to Google Docs. It allows users to format text
                with different sizes, alignments, colours and most importantly speak the text for user in different voices.
              <br/><br/>
              It includes automatic features like making the text: <br/>
              
                Large, Regular, Small, Bold, Italic, Underline, Align(left, center, right), colourful(green, blue, red, black)
              
                <br/>

                One key technology it includes is that it also SPEAKS the formatted text for you in different voices.

                <br/> <br/>

                I was always fasicanted as a teenage how the most used application works i.e. Google Docs and that fascination of technology
                led me to build my own customized online text editor with additional features.

              <p>This is a portal built for JavaScript Coaches at Clever Programmer. I work at Clever Programmer
                and we have a team of 40 JavaScript Coaches working with us and we have a community of more than 
                2000 students. When we started, we had no idea one day we would have 40 coaches with us and as we
                did, we realized there is a huge lack of communication between students and coaches and that is how
                the idea to build this portal came up. 
                <br/> <br/>
                This portal helps students better find and connect with one of the coaches. It was build by me and few of
                the other coaches. We have deligently developed this portal taking care every prospects and make an easy user expereince
                for students. I would say I had really fun building it with some of the most amazing people.
                <br/> <br/>
                JavaScript Success Coaches(JSC) portal is built to:<br/>
                - Help students to read about every coaches <br/>
                - Find out what time zone they are in(We had coaches from 12 different countries)
                <br/>
                - Contact them direclty
                <br/>
                - Explain what we do
                <br/>
                - Explore the list of coaches
                <br/>
                - To learn about their skills
                <br/>
                - To book a personal coaching call
                <br/><br/>
                NOTE: <br/>
                - This portal is not live yet on the main domain as we are still working on polishing it  <br/>
                I was a JavaScript Success Coach when I first started working with Clever Programmer

              <p>I am fond of chat applications and one of the biggest chat app we use the most is the Facebook Messenger and that is the reason I have built a clone very similar to it.
                It always made me curious how this chat applications work and as I was learning React, I went in depth and figured out all the concepts how a chat app works and went further and built
                this messenger clone but most importantly in a dark theme. I implemented Material UI in this project as I was always hype about the debate between Bootstrap and Material UI and I would not lie
                Material UI was very easy to work with which helped to build a top grade UI with super easy user experience. 
                <br/><br/>
                Features of the messenger clone:<br/>
                - Allows user to enter their name <br/>
                - Greet user using thier name <br/>
                - Allows user to send a message <br/>
                - Allows user to see messages sent by other users <br/>
                - It has beautiful user interface <br/>
                - Easy to use <br/>
                - Uses Firebase Firestore as a database to store data so no messages are lost <br/>
                - Works faster than a Bugatti <br/>

              <p> This webiste was built in my college with one of good friend, Brandon. Every group had to come up with a business idea and our idea was to make a job matching portal like Indeed but which is only for refugees in Canada.
                We came up with this idea when we realsied there are more than 1M refugees are expected in Canada but we when we researched, the unemployment rate for them in 2019 was 13%(growth by 7% in that year) and we could expect to see more
                as the number of refugees enter Canada and that is why we decided to help those people by easing their transition into Canadian job market by connecting them with their native owner as that would be the easiest first job for them as
                the communications will me much easier with theri native owners. We wanted to fill that gap with the help of Jobify and to promote our app we developed this promotion portal.
